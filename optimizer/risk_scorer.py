"""
Composite Maritime Risk Index Scorer.
Calculates a 0-100 risk score based on:
1. Freight Volatility Risk (from rolling 14-day std of BDI/BCI)
2. Monsoon / Bay of Bengal Cyclone Seasonality Risk
3. Port Congestion Risk (East Coast berth waiting days)
4. Geopolitical Disruption Risk (Canal rerouting probability)
5. Bunker Fuel Volatility Risk (VLSFO price deviation from baseline)
Returns a traffic-light risk dashboard (Green/Amber/Red) with weighted scoring.
