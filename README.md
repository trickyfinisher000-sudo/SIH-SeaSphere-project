## 📌 Executive Summary
Indian steel public sector enterprises import tens of millions of metric tonnes of **metallurgical (coking) coal**, thermal coal, limestone, and manganese from overseas mining hubs (Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, USA, Russia) to deep and riverine discharge ports along the **East Coast of India** (Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Haldia, Dhamra, Krishnapatnam).

Historically, PSU procurement managers relied on reactive daily spot market exploration. Because global dry bulk freight rates (Baltic Capesize/Panamax indices) swing wildly by 30% to 80% within weeks, this reactive approach causes:
1. **Chartering at Market Peaks:** Missing multi-million-dollar cost-saving opportunities.
2. **Suboptimal Vessel Selection:** Inefficiently choosing vessel classes (Capesize, Panamax, Supramax) without accounting for dynamic cargo draft and destination port draft limits (e.g. Haldia riverine draft bottlenecks requiring expensive offshore lightering).
3. **Heavy Demurrage Exposure:** Unplanned port congestion and weather delays triggering $15,000–$35,000/day idle penalties per vessel.
4. **Siloed Planning:** Decoupling ocean freight from inland Indian Railways rake logistics.

**SeaSphere** transforms this process into an **intelligent predictive and prescriptive decision support platform**.

## 🌟 Key Innovations & Features

### 1. Multi-Horizon AI Freight Forecasting Engine
- **Hybrid Machine Learning:** Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) trained on 6+ years of daily maritime indicators.
- **Probabilistic Horizons:** Generates multi-horizon forecasts (+7, +15, +30, +60, +90 days) with $P_{10}$ (optimistic), $P_{50}$ (expected median), and $P_{90}$ (risk bound) confidence intervals.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Real-time feature attribution waterfall detailing how marine bunker fuel (Singapore VLSFO), Baltic momentum, port queues, and Bay of Bengal monsoon seasonality drive the forward rate.

### 2. Vessel Chartering & Market Entry Optimizer
- **Dynamic Arrival Draft Calculation:** Calculates vessel operating draft based on actual cargo parcel deadweight:
  $$\text{Arrival Draft} = \text{Ballast Draft} + (\text{Design Draft} - \text{Ballast Draft}) \times \frac{\text{Cargo Tonnage}}{\text{Max DWT}}$$
- **Lightering & Draft Feasibility Check:** Automatically checks draft clearance and flags shallow riverine ports (like Haldia) requiring offshore transshipment.
- **Optimal 5-Day Laycan Window:** Analyzes the forward cost curve to identify the exact 5-day loading tender window that minimizes charter cost.
- **Contract Type Evaluation:** Compares **Spot Voyage Charter**, **Short-term Time Charter (TC)**, and **Contract of Affreightment (COA)**.

### 3. Total Landed Cost (TLC) & Port Gateway Optimizer
- Evaluates the end-to-end supply chain landed cost to major Indian blast furnaces (SAIL Rourkela, Bokaro, Durgapur, IISCO, Bhilai, RINL Vizag):
  $$\text{TLC} = \text{FOB Price} + \text{Ocean Freight} + \text{Bunker Surcharge (BAF)} + \text{Port Dues} + \text{Demurrage Risk} + \text{Inland Rail Freight}$$
- Compares discharge ports (Paradip vs Dhamra vs Vizag vs Haldia) and quantifies the exact savings of the optimal gateway.

### 4. Crisis & What-If Stress-Testing Simulator
- Interactive sensitivity sliders to stress-test supply chain shocks in real-time:
  - Marine Bunker Fuel Spikes (-30% to +60% VLSFO)
  - Monsoon Swells & Cyclone Port Delays (+0 to +10 Days waiting time)
  - Global Baltic Paper Squeeze
  - Geopolitical Canal Rerouting (Suez Canal / Red Sea closure forcing circumnavigation via Cape of Good Hope)
- Prescribes tactical mitigations (slow-steaming, bunker hedging, port diversion, 24-hr NOR renegotiation).

### 5. Interactive Web Dashboard
- **Theme:** Dark maritime glassmorphism UI with electric cyan and mint emerald accents.
- **Interactive Maritime Map:** Visualizes shipping lanes, overseas origin hubs, East Coast ports, and animated vessel tracks via Leaflet.js.
- **Executive Tender Brief:** One-click generation of procurement briefs formatted for Ministry of Steel / PSU tender boards.

## 🎤 Presentation Pitch for SIH Jury & Evaluators

When presenting to the Ministry of Steel and Hackathon Jury, highlight these four key value propositions:

1. **Direct Financial Impact:**
   - On a typical Cape parcel of 150,000 MT of Australian coking coal, a $2.50/MT freight optimization saves **$375,000 per voyage**.
   - For an annual PSU procurement quota of 15–20 million MT, SeaSphere can deliver **₹150 to ₹300 Crores** in annual foreign exchange savings.

2. **Resolving Port Bottlenecks (Haldia vs. Dhamra):**
   - Evaluators love when you demonstrate domain nuances: e.g., Haldia Dock has an 8.5m riverine draft requiring lightering or daughter vessels (+ $6.80/T penalty). SeaSphere dynamically analyzes whether discharging a Capesize at deepwater Dhamra (18m draft) and raking by Indian Railways to Durgapur/Bokaro is cheaper than direct Handymax into Haldia!

3. **Explainable AI vs. Black-Box Models:**
   - PSU committees cannot make decisions on opaque neural networks. SeaSphere shows exact dollar-per-tonne attributions (Bunker fuel impact, Baltic forward momentum, berth waiting time, monsoon seasonality).

4. **Crisis Readiness:**
   - Demonstrating the live What-If Crisis Simulator (e.g. Red Sea/Suez Canal rerouting adding 12 days and $7.50/T) proves the system is production-ready for real-world geopolitical uncertainties.
